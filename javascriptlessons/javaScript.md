#1 Waypoint: Comment your JavaScript Code
Comments are lines of code that your computer will intentionally ignore. Comments are a great way to leave notes to yourself and to other people who will later need to figure out what it does.

Let's take a look at the two ways you can write comments in JavaScript.

The double-slash comment will comment out the remainder of the text on the current line:

`// This is a comment.`

The slash-star-star-slash comment will comment out everything between the /* and the */ characters:

`/* This is also a comment */`

Try creating one of each.

And one more thing you need to notice. Starting at this waypoint in JavaScript related challenges (except AngularJS, all Ziplines, Git, Node.js and Express.js, MongoDB and Full Stack JavaScript Projects) you can see contents of assert() functions (in some challenges except(), assert.equal() and so on) which are used to test your code. It's part of these challenges that you are able to see the tests that are running against your code.

#2 Waypoint: Understand Boolean Values
In computer science, data structures are things that hold data. JavaScript has seven of these. For example, the `Number` data structure holds numbers.

Let's learn about the most basic data structure of all: the `Boolean`. Booleans can only hold the value of either true or false. They are basically little on-off switches.

Let's modify our welcomeToBooleansfunction so that it will return `trueinstead` of `falsewhen` the run button is clicked.
